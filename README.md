# Text Summarization model
This project outlines a systematic procedure for constructing a deep learning model using LSTM architecture, incorporating an attention layer. Additionally, it covers the
steps to save the resulting model and load it, along with a custom-built attention layer.

## how to improve this model
* Use a larger dataset.
* Use a pretrained embedding instead of training your embedding layer (ex. Word2Vec).
* Try different architectures (ex. BiLSTM).
